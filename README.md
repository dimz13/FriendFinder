## How it works
  - You are invited to take a survey and answer 10 questions with answer choices from 1(Strongly Disagree) to 5(Strongly Agree)
  - Users answers are compared against the existing customer data.
  - The least difference in scores between the new user and existing user in the system will be the most compatible.Like Below:
  - User 1: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
  - User 2: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
  - Total Difference: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
